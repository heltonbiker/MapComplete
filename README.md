# MapComplete

## Mapping software that does what you want.

Desired Features:

 - Use KML files - as many as you want! - to store and manage your collection of tracks.
 - Easily create and modify waypoints, segments and road networks.
 - Open multiple files at a time and move or copy features between them with drag-and-drop.
 - Choose any tile server you want, either from our presets or with your "getTileUrl" template.
 - (in construction...)

----------------------------

## Installation:

Currently we have no installer. To run the program:

1. Clone the repository, or download it as a zip and extract it;
2. Execute the `MapComplete.py` file in the root folder.
